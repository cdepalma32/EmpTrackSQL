  ## Description
  This application accepts user input to view all departments, roles, employees, add a department, role, or employee, as well as updating an employee role.
  By utilizing MySQL2 and Inquirer packages, the app allows the user to interact via the command line to view, create and update the information within/from the database:
  Viewing all departments presents a table showing department names and Id's.
  Viewing all roles presents job title, role id, department the role belongs to and the salary for the role.
  Viewing all employees presents a table showing employee id's, first and last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers the employee reports to.
  Adding a department, role and employee are also functions that are applicable and prompted by questions to input the data using inquirer.
